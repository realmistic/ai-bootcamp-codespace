      "I never planned to be involved in trading. I was taught that markets are generally efficient, making it difficult for a rookie investor to earn money before experienced traders and algorithmic robots capture all the margins. So, I focused on my core job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything changed in July 2019 when Revolut announced commission-free stock trading, lowering the barrier to entry to essentially zero. By the end of that year, the market had gained over 28%—a historic rise. Then, in early 2020, COVID-19 triggered a 30% market crash in just three months [(Wiki: 2020 stock market crash)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash). I didn’t believe that fundamental growth factors were broken, so I saw an opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized that if I could earn more than my 3% annual mortgage rate, I could increase my total wealth by following a conservative investment strategy—without ever needing to make another early mortgage repayment.\n",
      "\n",
      "With over a decade of experience in business analysis and market research, I wanted to apply my skills to test the financial hypotheses and ideas I encountered in the press.\n",
      "\n",
      "I began investing a significant portion of my free cash flow into the stock market. This not only accelerated my learning but also gave me the satisfaction of building something for myself.\n",

I was taught that markets are generally efficient, making it difficult for a rookie investor to earn money before experienced traders and algorithmic robots capture all the margins. So, I focused on my core job.\\n\\nEverything changed in July 2019 when Revolut announced commission-free stock trading, lowering the barrier to entry to essentially zero. By the end of that year, the market had gained over 28%—a historic rise. Then, in early 2020, COVID-19 triggered a 30% market crash in just three months [(Wiki: 2020 stock market crash)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash). I didn’t believe that fundamental growth factors were broken, so I saw an opportunity.\\n\\nI realized that if I could earn more than my 3% annual mortgage rate, I could increase my total wealth by following a conservative investment strategy—without ever needing to make another early mortgage repayment.\\n\\nWith over a decade of experience in business analysis and market research, I wanted to apply my skills to test the financial hypotheses and ideas I encountered in the press.\\n\\nI began investing a significant portion of my free cash flow into the stock market. This not only accelerated my learning but also gave me the satisfaction of building something for myself.\\n\\nReach Out\\n---------\\n\\n### LinkedIn\\n\\n### Follow me\\n\\n### E-mail\\n\\n### [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-brigida-0b961319/)[Ivan Brigida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-brigida-0b961319/)\\n\\n### [info@ pythoninvest.com](mailto:info@pysteps.com)\\n\\n### Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest news\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg)\\n\\n[](https://realmistic.medium.com/)\\n\\n[](https://github.com/realmistic?tab=repositories)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3732-6461-4139-a162-373433636137/Frame_6.svg)](https://github.com/realmistic/PythonInvest-basic-fin-analysis)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3230-3538-4464-b239-393930616163/Frame_5.svg)](https://realmistic.medium.com/)\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild6439-6236-4562-b832-643835346465/Frame_4.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg)\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://thb.tildacdn.net/tild3833-3535-4238-b730-386132336462/-/resize/20x/138-1388876_cookie-b.png)](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n[Home](https://pythoninvest.com/)\\n\\n[Blog](https://pythoninvest.com/blog)\\n\\n[Course](https://pythoninvest.com/course)\\n\\n[Contacts](https://pythoninvest.com/contacts)\\n\\nPYTHON\\n\\n[|]\\n\\n[](https://pythoninvest.com/)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg)\\n\\n[](https://realmistic.medium.com/)\\n\\n[](https://github.com/realmistic/PythonInvest-basic-fin-analysis)\\n\\n![Image 12](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3732-6461-4139-a162-373433636137/Frame_6.svg)\\n\\n![Image 13](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3230-3538-4464-b239-393930616163/Frame_5.svg)\\n\\n![Image 14](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild6439-6236-4562-b832-643835346465/Frame_4.svg)\\n\\n[![Image 15](https://thb.tildacdn.net/tild3833-3535-4238-b730-386132336462/-/resize/20x/138-1388876_cookie-b.png)](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n© 2020-2025 PythonInvest\\n\\nAll rights reserved \\n\\n[Privacy Policy](https://pythoninvest.com/Privacy)\\n\\nDo you have any questions?

I was taught that markets are generally efficient, making it difficult for a rookie investor to earn money before experienced traders and algorithmic robots capture all the margins. So, I focused on my core job.\\n\\nEverything changed in July 2019 when Revolut announced commission-free stock trading, lowering the barrier to entry to essentially zero. By the end of that year, the market had gained over 28%—a historic rise. Then, in early 2020, COVID-19 triggered a 30% market crash in just three months [(Wiki: 2020 stock market crash)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash). I didn’t believe that fundamental growth factors were broken, so I saw an opportunity.\\n\\nI realized that if I could earn more than my 3% annual mortgage rate, I could increase my total wealth by following a conservative investment strategy—without ever needing to make another early mortgage repayment.\\n\\nWith over a decade of experience in business analysis and market research, I wanted to apply my skills to test the financial hypotheses and ideas I encountered in the press.\\n\\nI began investing a significant portion of my free cash flow into the stock market. This not only accelerated my learning but also gave me the satisfaction of building something for myself.\\n\\nReach Out\\n---------\\n\\n### LinkedIn\\n\\n### Follow me\\n\\n### E-mail\\n\\n### [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-brigida-0b961319/)[Ivan Brigida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-brigida-0b961319/)\\n\\n### [info@ pythoninvest.com](mailto:info@pysteps.com)\\n\\n### Sign up for our newsletter to get the latest news\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg)\\n\\n[](https://realmistic.medium.com/)\\n\\n[](https://github.com/realmistic?tab=repositories)\\n\\n[![Image 8](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3732-6461-4139-a162-373433636137/Frame_6.svg)](https://github.com/realmistic/PythonInvest-basic-fin-analysis)\\n\\n[![Image 9](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3230-3538-4464-b239-393930616163/Frame_5.svg)](https://realmistic.medium.com/)\\n\\n[![Image 10](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild6439-6236-4562-b832-643835346465/Frame_4.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg)\\n\\n[![Image 11](https://thb.tildacdn.net/tild3833-3535-4238-b730-386132336462/-/resize/20x/138-1388876_cookie-b.png)](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n[Home](https://pythoninvest.com/)\\n\\n[Blog](https://pythoninvest.com/blog)\\n\\n[Course](https://pythoninvest.com/course)\\n\\n[Contacts](https://pythoninvest.com/contacts)\\n\\nPYTHON\\n\\n[|]\\n\\n[](https://pythoninvest.com/)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n[](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZb99NG1IE75c5qH2mCuqVg)\\n\\n[](https://realmistic.medium.com/)\\n\\n[](https://github.com/realmistic/PythonInvest-basic-fin-analysis)\\n\\n![Image 12](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3732-6461-4139-a162-373433636137/Frame_6.svg)\\n\\n![Image 13](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild3230-3538-4464-b239-393930616163/Frame_5.svg)\\n\\n![Image 14](https://static.tildacdn.net/tild6439-6236-4562-b832-643835346465/Frame_4.svg)\\n\\n[![Image 15](https://thb.tildacdn.net/tild3833-3535-4238-b730-386132336462/-/resize/20x/138-1388876_cookie-b.png)](https://twitter.com/python_invest)\\n\\n© 2020-2025 PythonInvest\\n\\nAll rights reserved \\n\\n[Privacy Policy](https://pythoninvest.com/Privacy)\\n\\nDo you have any questions?

      "\n",
      "The **capybara**, or greater capybara (*Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris*), is recognized as the largest living rodent and is native to South America. These creatures thrive in various habitats, including savannas and dense forests, but are particularly drawn to environments near water bodies. Known for their social behavior, capybaras often form large groups, varying from 10 to as many as 100 individuals. Their diet mainly includes grasses and aquatic plants, and they display unique feeding behaviors such as coprophagy, which allows them to extract maximum nutrients from their food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Capybaras are remarkable swimmers, able to stay submerged for up to five minutes, which helps them evade predators. They primarily graze on grasses, adapting their diet according to seasonal availability. While they are not considered threatened, their populations can be affected by hunting and habitat loss in some areas of South America. The meat of capybaras is consumed in certain cultures, particularly during religious observances like Lent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of domestication, capybaras have gained popularity in urban areas and zoos, often featured in videos and memes due to their gentle demeanor and social nature, contributing to their charming image in popular culture. \n",

    "  STEP 1: Formulate 2-3 specific search queries related to the question.\n",
    "  - Break down the question into key concepts\n",
