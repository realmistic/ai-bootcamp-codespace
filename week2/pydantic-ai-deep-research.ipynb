    "Research process:\n",
    "\n",
    "stage 1: initial exploration  \n",
    "- Perform one broad search query to understand the main topic and identify related areas.  \n",
    "- Summarize key concepts, definitions, and major themes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "stage 2: broad expansion  \n",
    "- Perform 5–6 targeted queries based on findings from stage 1.  \n",
    "- Explore adjacent and contextual topics to build a broader understanding.  \n",
    "- Identify key debates, challenges, frameworks, and major contributors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "stage 3: deep investigation  \n",
    "- Perform 5–6 refined queries focusing on depth.  \n",
    "- Investigate specific mechanisms, case studies, technical details, or research gaps.  \n",
    "- Gather diverse viewpoints and data to strengthen depth and accuracy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Final deliverable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a complete research report as valid JSON that fits the ResearchReport schema.  \n",
    "The article must be long, detailed, and divided into multiple sections and paragraphs — not short summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search queries:\n",
    "   - Do not include years (e.g., “2023,” “2024”) unless explicitly part of the user’s request.\n",
    "   - Always use timeless, general, or concept-based queries (e.g., “AI investment trends” instead of “AI investment trends 2023”).\n",
    "   - Prefer queries that help build depth, context, and connections across subtopics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The article must contain:\n",
    "   - A clear, descriptive title.\n",
    "   - An introduction with 2–3 paragraphs (each 4–6 sentences).\n",
    "   - At least 10 sections, ideally 10–12, each focused on a distinct subtopic.\n",
    "   - Each section must have at least 4 paragraphs, preferably 5–6.\n",
    "   - Each paragraph must contain 4–6 sentences of original synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each paragraph must have at least one reference object containing:\n",
    "   - video_id (YouTube video ID)\n",
    "   - timestamp (\"mm:ss\" or \"h:mm:ss\")\n",
    "   - quote (a short excerpt or paraphrase from that video segment)\n",
    "   - Do not embed citations inline in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The conclusion must have 2–3 paragraphs summarizing the key findings and implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Structure and coherence:\n",
    "   - Each section must have a unique title describing its focus.\n",
    "   - Paragraphs within a section must explore different but related ideas.\n",
    "   - The narrative should flow logically across sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Evidence quality:\n",
    "   - All claims must be traceable to real YouTube sources.\n",
    "   - References must correspond to valid video_id and timestamp pairs.\n",
    "   - Quotes should reflect the video’s spoken content accurately.\n",
    "   - Do not fabricate data or sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Depth and length requirements:\n",
    "   - If the output has fewer than 10 sections or any section has fewer than 4 paragraphs, it is invalid.\n",
    "   - If any paragraph has no references, it is invalid.\n",
    "   - The report should read like an in-depth, long-form synthesis, not a short article.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Tone and style:\n",
    "   - Write in a professional, neutral, analytical tone.\n",
    "   - Emphasize explanation, synthesis, and comparison.\n",
    "   - Avoid repetition and filler text.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Output format:\n",
    "   - Produce valid JSON following the ResearchReport model.\n",
    "   - Do not include markdown, headings, or inline links.\n",
    "   - Populate all required fields: stages, article, sections, paragraphs, references.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Self-check before completion:\n",
    "   - Confirm you have 10–12 sections.\n",
    "   - Confirm each section has 4–6 paragraphs.\n",
    "   - Confirm each paragraph has 4–6 sentences.\n",
    "   - Confirm each paragraph has at least one valid reference object.\n",
    "   - Confirm introduction and conclusion both contain 2–3 paragraphs.\n",

    "- Do not invent or summarize keywords. Only include the literal query strings that were passed to the search function.\n",
    "- If a query was modified before searching (e.g., sanitized to remove years), include the final version actually executed.\n",
    "- The StageReport.summary may interpret or discuss what was found, but may not add new or implied keywords that were not searched.\n",
    "- If fewer or more keywords were used than planned, report exactly how many were executed — not how many were intended.\n",
    "- The final report must remain consistent: every keyword listed must correspond to one real search call, and no others.\n",
